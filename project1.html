    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Krishna Mittal, a passionate and self-motivated web developer with a keen interest in crafting modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy transforming ideas into interactive digital experiences that are both functional and visually appealing.

My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity about how websites work, which quickly grew into a deep interest in front-end technologies. Since then, I’ve taken on a variety of personal and collaborative projects that have helped me sharpen my skills, learn new tools, and gain hands-on experience in building practical web solutions. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and designing interfaces that enhance user experience.</p>
